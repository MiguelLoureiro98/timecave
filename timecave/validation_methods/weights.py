"""
This module contains built-in functions to compute weights for validation methods that so require.

Functions
---------
constant_weights
    Generates constant weights (i.e. every fold is weighted equally).

linear_weights
    Folds are weighted linearly.

exponential_weights
    Folds are weighted exponentially.

Notes
-----
Users may write their own weighting function and pass it as an argument to a validation method class. 
However, to make sure that the user-defined function is compatible with TimeCaVe, the function signature 
must match those of the functions provided herein.

def constant_weights(
    n_splits: int, gap: int = 0, compensation: int = 0, params: dict = None
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute constant weights.

    This function computes a constant weight vector. It is called by the [Growing Window](../prequential/grow.md), 
    [Rolling Window](../prequential/roll.md), and [Block CV](../CV/block.md) by default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int
        Number of splits the validation method will use.

    gap : int, default=0
        Number of folds separating the validation set from the training set. \
        Used by [prequential methods](../prequential/index.md).

    compensation : int, default=0
        A compensation factor that allows the function to generate the correct amount of weights. \
        0 for [CV methods](../CV/index.md), +1 for [prequential methods](../prequential/index.md). \
        Additionally, if a gap is specified, it must be added to this compensation factor as well.

    params : dict, default=None
        Used for compatibility. Irrelevant for this function.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Weights.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from timecave.validation_methods.weights import constant_weights
    >>> constant_weights(5);
    array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])

    If a gap is specified, there will be fewer iterations. Therefore, fewer weights should be generated:

    >>> constant_weights(5, gap=1);
    array([1., 1., 1., 1.])

    For a given number of folds, CV methods will run for an additional iteration compared to prequential 
    methods. Therefore, a compensation factor of 1 must be specified if one intends to use weighted prequential 
    methods:

    >>> constant_weights(5, gap=1, compensation=1);
    array([1., 1., 1.])

def linear_weights(

    """
    Compute linear weights.

    This function computes a linear weight vector. It may be passed to the [Growing Window](../prequential/grow.md), 
    [Rolling Window](../prequential/roll.md), and [Block CV](../CV/block.md) classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int
        Number of splits the validation method will use.

    gap : int, default=0
        Number of folds separating the validation set from the training set. \
        Used by [prequential methods](../prequential/index.md).

    compensation : int, default=0
        A compensation factor that allows the function to generate the correct amount of weights. \
        0 for [CV methods](../CV/index.md), +1 for [prequential methods](../prequential/index.md). \
        Additionally, if a gap is specified, it must be added to this compensation factor as well.

    params : dict, default=None
        Parameters from which to generate the weights. Only `slope` needs to be specified. 
        Any other parameter will be ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Weights.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `slope` is neither an integer nor a float.

    ValueError
        If `slope` is not positive.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from timecave.validation_methods.weights import linear_weights
    >>> linear_weights(5);
    array([0.06666667, 0.13333333, 0.2       , 0.26666667, 0.33333333])

    If a gap is specified, there will be fewer iterations. Therefore, fewer weights should be generated:
