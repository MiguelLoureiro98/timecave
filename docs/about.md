# About

TimeCaVe is a Python package that provides off-the-shelf model validation methods for time series modelling tasks.
The package was developed by two graduate research assistants at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), University of Lisbon, Portugal.

This project would not have seen the light of day without the support of the Mechanical Engineering Institute ([IDMEC](https://www.idmec.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/)) and the 
Laboratory of Intelligent Systems for Data Analysis, Modeling and Optimization ([IS4](https://is4.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/)).
